# Business Funnel & Monthly Cohorts — Acquisition → Activation → Retention

**Goal**  
Provide a clear, actionable view of the full conversion funnel and month-over-month cohort retention to spot where we lose users and where to intervene.

**Data/Tools**  
Excel (0.0.Business Analytics Project.xlsx). Sheets include:
`conversion_funnel`, `retention_rates`, `cohort_analysis`, `purchase_activity`,
`first_purchase`, `raw_user_activity`.

**What it shows**
- Funnel by stage (view → cart → purchase) with % conversion at each step
- Cohort retention grid (Month 0..N) by first-purchase month
- Purchase activity by cohort age & month
- Suggested actions (improve onboarding, day-7 re-engagement, win-back)
